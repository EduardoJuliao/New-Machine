# Setup

These scripts helps configure a new development environment.

## How to use

1. Download the files
2. Open a new instance of powershell in admin mode
3. navigate to the folder
4. run `machines\Machines.ps1`
5. Open a new instance of powershell in admin mode (needed because powershell needs to be refreshed)
6. run `machines\WebApps.ps1`

### Optional use

`lib\variables` can install multiple Customer Portals, just add a new object to the array.

⚠⚠ Objects with same name will break the flow 😊
