.NAME
    SqlWaitForAG

.DESCRIPTION
    The `SqlWaitForAG` DSC resource will wait for a cluster role/group to be
    created. This is used to wait for an Availability Group to create the
    cluster role/group in the cluster.

    ## Requirements

    * Target machine must be running Windows Server 2012 or later.
    * Target machine must be running SQL Server Database Engine 2012 or later.
    * Target machine must have access to the Failover Cluster PowerShell module.

    ## Security Requirements

    * The account running this resource must have permission in the cluster to be able
      to run the cmdlet Get-ClusterGroup.

    ## Known issues

    * This resource evaluates if the Windows Failover Cluster role/group
      has been created. But the Windows Failover Cluster role/group is created
      before the Availability Group is in a ready state. When the Windows Failover
      Cluster role/group is found the resource will wait one more time
      according to the value of `RetryIntervalSec` before returning. There is
      currently no check to validate that the Availability Group was successfully
      created and is in a ready state. A workaround is instead use [`WaitForAny`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/reference/resources/windows/waitforanyresource?view=powershell-7)
      resource. This is being tracked in [issue #1569](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1569).

    All issues are not listed here, see [here for all open issues](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+in%3Atitle+SqlWaitForAG).

.PARAMETER Name
    Key - String
    Name of the cluster role/group to look for (normally the same as the Availability Group name).

.PARAMETER RetryIntervalSec
    Write - UInt64
    The interval, in seconds, to check for the presence of the cluster role/group. Default value is 20 seconds. When the cluster role/group has been found the resource will wait for this amount of time once more before returning.

.PARAMETER RetryCount
    Write - UInt32
    Maximum number of retries until the resource will timeout and throw an error. Default values is 30 times.

.PARAMETER GroupExist
    Read - Boolean
    Returns $true if the cluster role/group exist, otherwise it returns $false. Used by Get.

.EXAMPLE 1

This example will wait for the cluster role/group 'AGTest1'.

Configuration Example
{
    param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]
        $SqlAdministratorCredential
    )

    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'SqlServerDsc'

    node localhost
    {
        SqlWaitForAG 'SQLConfigureAG-WaitAGTest1'
        {
            Name                 = 'AGTest1'
            RetryIntervalSec     = 20
            RetryCount           = 30

            PsDscRunAsCredential = $SqlAdministratorCredential
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 2

This example will wait for both the cluster roles/groups 'AGTest1' and 'AGTest2'.

Configuration Example
{
    param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]
        $SqlAdministratorCredential
    )

    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'SqlServerDsc'

    node localhost
    {
        SqlWaitForAG 'SQLConfigureAG-WaitAGTest1'
        {
            Name                 = 'AGTest1'
            RetryIntervalSec     = 20
            RetryCount           = 30

            PsDscRunAsCredential = $SqlAdministratorCredential
        }

        SqlWaitForAG 'SQLConfigureAG-WaitAGTest2'
        {
            Name                 = 'AGTest2'
            RetryIntervalSec     = 20
            RetryCount           = 30

            PsDscRunAsCredential = $SqlAdministratorCredential
        }
    }
}
